    "## A3: Navigation Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactive dashboard project is composed of a story with two story points, which is a minimalist way of displaying two dashboards created. The two story points are based on two different groups of metrics. First, national/state customer internet averages. Second, customer internet averages are based on age groups. Selecting National/State AVG on the top center loads the first dashboard which includes two filters on the top right for Customer Churn and State selections. The National/State AVG dashboard has four data representations: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Nation Internet AVG on the top which highlights the current customer percentage with an internet subscription versus the national internet average and the variance to that national average. \n",
    "- Customer State Internet AVG shows the customer percentage of the current selection of the state filter with an internet subscription versus the national internet average and the variance to that national average.\n",
    "- States Ranked by Internet AVG on the bottom left ranks all states in descending order by customer internet subscription versus the national reference line. \n",
    "- Customer Counts by State on the bottom right is a map with a visual size representation of customers within each state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The story point selection on the top center of Age Group AVG displays the relevant dashboard for Age groups with two filters for Age Group and State. The age group filter is a single selection dropdown that interacts with the state data presentations. This dashboard is composed of three data presentations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Nation Internet Age AVG on the top highlights the current customer percentage with an internet subscription versus the national internet average and the variance to that national average. \n",
    "    - The data presentation and metrics are broken down into the two age groups of 18 to 64 years and 65 years & older.\n",
    "- Customer State Internet Age AVG in the middle is the current selection of the state filter with an internet subscription versus the national internet age group average and the variance to that national age group average.\n",
    "- States Ranked by Internet Age AVG bottom ranks all states in descending order by customer internet subscription versus the national age group reference line. \n",

    "\n",
    "## C1: Dashboard AlignmentÂ \n",
    "\n",
    "In the data dictionary, three takeaways guided me in the path of building the interactive dashboard in the project (D210 Churn Data Consideration and Dictionary, 2023):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Given that it costs 10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.\n",
    "    - Build a data dashboard to enable executive leaders to explore the data, identify trends, and compare key metrics.\n",
    "    - Present broad and understandable insights from the data that are relevant to their perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "I focused on the internet subscription average as my focus for the dashboard as these are current customers that we can retain at a lower cost and offer additional services. The chosen supplemental dataset provides national internet subscription data as a whole and by age group for the creation of metrics, section C2 will discuss the insights of this dataset. I built interactive dashboards with the executive team's focuses in mind when incorporating the data representations, audience analysis will be discussed further in section C7. The interactive controls help focus on areas that their perspective teams might need to dive deep to analyse. I also chose to use two dashboards to focus on internet subscription average by age group to align with leaders that focused on behavior and demographics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C2: Additional Data Set InsightsÂ \n",
    "\n",
    "The data dictionary lays out the need for identifying trends and comparing key metrics with no mention of the current performance of the company or past data to identify a trend. The first thing that came to mind is having a baseline to compare against and the American Community Survey on Types of Internet Subscriptions by Selected Characteristics provided national figures as a whole and by age group to compare to. Now being able to summarize the customer churn database and compare it to the second dataset with the figure provides valuable insights to action on. Actionable insights will be presented in the Panopto presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C3: Decision-Making Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The first interactive dashboard was made to have the impact of an executive dashboard. This led me to create simple data representations that highlight important metrics and are sorted to highlight actionable items. Customer National Internet AVG is made up of aggregate customers with an internet subscription and the variance to the national average. This data representation is made to refresh anytime the data is updated to act as a pulse check of how the company's internet subscription is currently doing. Executives can use this average to determine the company's health and if any strategies need to be put in place to impact the metric. States Ranked by Internet AVG is a data representation that breakouts and sorts the Internet average by state in descending order. Executives and Regional VPs can use this data representation to take a deep dive on states that not performing as well as the national internet average. The state rankings can also be compared by selection in the state filter which will be discussed further in section C4. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C4: Interactive Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "The State interactive control is found on both dashboards, it impacts all the data representation minus the two national representations on the top of each page. The state filter was implemented due to the audience overview mentioned in the data dictionary. With the executive team having regional duties it seemed fitting to along the ability to drill down into regions or states to understand internet subscription averages they are responsible for. A comparison of states is also possible with the filter. The Age Group interactive control is found on the Age Group AVG dashboard which is a single selection drop-down to separate the age group metrics. The age group filter along with the state filter along further insights of state or region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## C5: Colorblindness\n",
    "\n",
    "I made an attempt to minimize the use of color wherever possible and use grayscale in the dashboards. Sandra Caballer's blog post was a helpful resource for understanding the impact of color on someone with colorblindness. The blog post continued to give advice on how to implement color with minimal impact. One of the tips I implemented was, \"If you would like to use two colors, try to use blue and orange. These will always be your ally, as they are considered the best color-friendly palette because of their evident contrast\" (Caballer, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "## C6: Data Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The story I wanted to highlight through the data representations are metrics comparing the current and national internet subscription averages. A metric is unbiased and highlights the current conditions compared to a baseline that can also be used to trend over time. The Customer National Internet AVG highlights the story of company performance as a whole for internet subscriptions, this is a quick pulse check that is loaded to see how the company is performing. The States Ranked by Internet AVG are in descending order and highlight states in need of attention to the executives. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C7: Audience Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A key takeaway from Goodman's book highlights my top focus from audience analysis that was implemented in my presentation, \"An audience-centered speaker gathers information about their audience and uses it to adjust speaking content and strategies\" (Goodman et al., 2023). The data dictionary's breakdown of the executive was a guide for creating the data presentations and metrics. I made sure to focus on what the audience could relate to to keep them engaged and have something to act on coming out of my presentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## C8: Universal Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The first aspect of universal access is making sure to accommodate any individual with the possibility of color blindness. Another huge contribution to universal access is utilizing Tableau Public to host the completed dashboard. Without the need for installation and availability anywhere with an internet connection. Below are two points the Tableau site highlighted (Tableau Public, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Published visualizations are available for anyone to see online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fully hosted: Tableau Public vizzes can handle millions of viewers. All infrastructure is managed by us at no cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C9: Effective Storytelling\n",
    "\n",
    "There were two effective storytelling rules I followed from a Indeed article, \"Follow a clear structure and ensure the audience can relate\" (10 rules for great storytelling (with tips to improve) - indeed, 2023). Following a clear structure helped keep the audience engaged throughout the concise presentation. Ensuring the audience can relate was something I implemented from the dashboard to throughout the presentation, knowing the audience can find value in what I am providing ensures engagement. \n",
